Project Name: Lie Detector

Abstract/Summary:
The Lie Detector project aims to detect lies using a Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) sensor and a heart rate monitor. It triggers a red LED and buzzer if a lie is detected, and a green LED if the user is telling the truth, based on sensor inputs.

Project Details:

Project Description:

Utilizes Arduino to create a lie detector that uses GSR and heart rate sensors.
Detects lies by monitoring changes in GSR and heart rate readings.
Outputs lie/truth indication through LEDs and buzzer.
Multiple Arduinos Setup:

Uses one Arduino for input (GSR and heart rate sensors) and another for output (LEDs and buzzer).
Communication via serial interface (RX/TX).
Expected Inputs/Outputs:

Inputs: GSR sensor and heart rate monitor.
Outputs: Red and green LEDs, buzzer.
Project Use:

Place GSR sensor on one hand and heart rate monitor on the other.
LEDs indicate lie/truth status based on sensor readings.
Buzzer alerts for detected lies.
Two Arduinos, Grove Base Shield, buzzer, red and green LEDs, heart rate monitor, GSR sensor, resistors.
